- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaddieBats
- 👀 I’m interested in bat acoustic monitoring with a focus on citizen science and forest research, using automated bat identification software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced R (seewave and tuneR are my foci) as well as the AWS suite and its integration with our sound classification system. I'm also perenially trying to figure out how to upload hundreds of terrabytes of wav files from SD cards onto hard drives.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open hardware, political ecological approaches to monitoring technologies and other charity-sector ecological data scientists.
- 📫 Reach me at mdavis@bats.org.uk / www.linkedin.com/in/madeline-davis-33a578288/
