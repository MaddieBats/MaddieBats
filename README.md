👋 @MaddieBats 

☺️ I am an ecologist-turned-tech girl working on bat bioacoustics

🦇 I am the Senior Science Projects Officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, within our Science and Monitoring team

👀 I work on our Sound Classification System, which is a pipeline designed to take extremely large amounts of passive acoustic monitoring data of UK bats and, through a machine-learning driven automated classifier of bat echolocation, quanitify species presence across the UK

💻 My competencies are in R, SQL, Python, Bash, and the AWS ecosystem alongside traditional ecological skills

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open hardware, political ecological approaches to monitoring technologies and other charity-sector ecological data scientists.
